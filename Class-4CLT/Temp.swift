The company's \"there\'s an app for that\" ad campaign drew millions of people, who over the years have bought more than a billion iPhones. And since the App Store was the only place to get programs for the iPhone, millions of developers flocked to Apple too. Now the tech giant is facing questions about whether it\'s running a monopoly, forced into the topic by Fortnite maker Epic Games and Epic\'s lawsuit alleging an abuse of power."

To do so, it commissioned a team of designers who came up with five new custom, original fonts named Tenorite, Bierstadt, Skeena, Seaford and Grandview. All five offer unique and refreshing takes on what makes a good, standard font, and Microsoft is now inviting the Internet to help them choose the best one."
